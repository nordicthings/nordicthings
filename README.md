Hi, Iâ€™m living in northern germany and i'm what you might call a "Fischkopp": somone who likes the flat land, the sea and the dialect spoken in this area.
Currently I am working as a software architect and I like clean, expressive code as well as good code craftsmanship and evolutionary software architecture.
This account has no special meaning, it's just used to host small libs or experiments I thought about at my daily work.
